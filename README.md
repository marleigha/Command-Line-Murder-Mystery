# Upskill 2025 Project: Command-Line-Murder-Mystery
made by ariel athena, emily, and marleigh !
### Project Pitch !
Welcome to GAME NAME, a command line murder mystery survival game. Start by choosing one of four characters to play. You can make your choice based on each character’s statistics. From there, make choices for your character through table-top role-play game style rolls. Be careful, a failed roll might result in your demise! GAME NAME is a fun use of the skills we’ve developed in our computer science classes. We’re building this game in the command line with Python. 

## WIREFRAMES:

#### Intro/Title Page! 
* tells you the premise of the story
* Character Picker where you can read the basic archetypes
* Then choose which character you'll be
* You don’t get to see the stats until after you choose them
#### Main Loop:
##### Text Output
* player reads and makes choices accordingly "A,b,c,d / 1,2,3,4"
* Player dies → give you the option to restart
* Player survives the night
* Might add a time mechanic, if we have the time!
* Or just you picked the right options to not die but haven’t figured out the mystery
* Player solves the mystery! by having the right items/making the right choices
##### Text Input
* Player responds to the choices, and you can:
    * Start dialogue & respond
    * Make checks & rolls
    * Pick up item
    * Esc: to view a menu with instructions
    * Restart
    * continue/enter: will allow you to move to the next text block (not to overwhelm the user)
    * i: to view your inventory

## MILESTONES:
Our Timeline!
* tuesday: 2hrs(ish), project planning and writing expectations
* wednesday: 2hrs – title/intro, then rudimentary choices saving the decisions/the input of the user
* thursday: 2hrs – fleshing out and building on the story & choices (maybe adding rolls)
* friday: polish !
* Stretch goal: inventory & dialogue !

The Order We're Executing in!
* Start with one character! – (and it’s own stats)
* Start with no rolls – just make the decision or don’t
    * if we implement a roll it should only be like one!
* Start with a simple story!
    * Choose 1 to solve the mystery
    * Choose 2 to wait for the killer to get you
* Develop a database to track the story structure: we're thinking the story structure is done best in a tree/graph
