# Upskill 2025 Project: Command-Line-Murder-Mystery
made by Ariel Athena, Emily, and Marleigh !
### Project Pitch !
Welcome to GAME NAME, a command line murder mystery survival game. Start by allocating stat points to your character in 6 categories: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. From there, make choices for your character through table-top role-play game style rolls and other decisions. Be careful, a failed roll might result in your demise! GAME NAME is a fun use of the skills we’ve developed in our computer science classes. We’re building this game in the command line with Python. 

## WIREFRAMES:

#### Intro/Title Page! 
* tells you the premise of the story
* Character stats allocation
#### Main Loop:
##### Text Output
* player reads and makes choices accordingly "A,b,c,d / 1,2,3,4"
* Player survives the night
* Might add a time mechanic, if we have the time!
* Or just you picked the right options to not die but haven’t figured out the mystery
* Player solves the mystery! by having the right items/making the right choices
##### Text Input
* Player responds to the choices, and you can:
    * Start dialogue & respond
    * Make checks & rolls
    * Extras:
       * Pick up item
       * Esc: to view a menu with instructions
       * Restart
       * i: to view your inventory

## MILESTONES:
Our Timeline!
* tuesday: 2hrs(ish), project planning and writing expectations
* wednesday: 2hrs – title/intro, then rudimentary choices saving the decisions/the input of the user
* thursday: 2hrs – fleshing out and building on the story & choices (maybe adding rolls)
* friday: polish !
* Stretch goal: inventory & dialogue !

The Order We're Executing in!
* Start with one character! – (and it’s own stats)
* Start with no rolls – just make the decision or don’t
    * if we implement a roll it should only be like one!
* Start with a simple story!
    * Choose 1 to solve the mystery
    * Choose 2 to wait for the killer to get you
* Develop a database to track the story structure: we're thinking the story structure is done best in a tree/graph
